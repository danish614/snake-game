A visually stunning Pygame-based snake animation that follows your mouse with smooth, wave-like body motion and a flicking tongue. The project demonstrates real-time animation, vector math, and trigonometric motion effects for lifelike movement.

## Features

Smooth, realistic snake motion using sine-wave physics

Dynamic flicking tongue animation

Reactive head rotation and shading for 3D depth

Mouse-follow movement with adaptive speed

Built purely with Python + Pygame (no external assets)
